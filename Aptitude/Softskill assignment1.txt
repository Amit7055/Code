I think the bread's fear of being eaten by humans as fear of death- how any normal human being scared of death, how any normal human constantly trying to escape it. 
But death is inevitable. There's nothing certain in this world except for death. 

In a way, it's a reminder to savor each moment, to pursue our passions, and to connect deeply with others while we have the chance. Just as the bread might fulfill its 
purpose by nourishing someone, we can find fulfillment in making meaningful contributions to the world and in the connections we forge with others along the way, so live 
your life to the fullest, make your dreams come true, fall in love, make mistakes, get back up, just don't give up. And later, when death finally arrives, 
you'll realize that it's actually not as scary, infamous or unpleasant as we think.
